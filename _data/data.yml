career-summary: |
  An IT professional who spent most of her working life in academia and research.

  Over the past 5 years committed to ongoing improvement of research software practice through training and community
  engagement work. Driving the trends in training for researchers and scientists in computational and data analysis skills forward
  by making key training strategic decisions and helping developing new curricula. Maintaining the UK’s pivotal role within
  the international research training community by running events, helping organisations and individuals deliver training
  for researchers and handling national and international collaborations and outreach with various communities.

  Prior to moving into project management and leadership, worked as a reseearch software engineer and gained experience in a variety of platforms, infrastructures,         technologies and programming languages. If I write code these days, it is mainly in Python or Ruby to extract, analyse, visualise and make sense of the data I work with    and to help automate my daily tasks or Jekyll/Liquid or some CMS to set up websites.
